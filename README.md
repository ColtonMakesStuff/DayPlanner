# DayPlanner

## Basic Daily Planner
### This is a simple daily planner that allows you to add items with a title, description, due time, and location. The items will be sorted based on time of day, and will be marked off as the time of day changes. They will turn yellow when it is a current time and red after the time has passed.

## How to use
### Open the webpage in a web browser.
### Click the "name here" button to customize your experiance.
### Enter a title, description, due time, and location for your item.
### Click the "Save" button.

## Features
### Sort items by time of day.
### Mark items off as the time of day changes.
### Color-code items based on their status (current, past, future).

## Known issues
### The planner is not fully responsive.
### The styling could be GREATLY improved.
### the edit button does not work
### checking off list items does not persist

## Apologies
### I apologize that this planner is not as polished as my other projects. I was at a science and technology convention in San Francisco for a large part of the week, and did not have the time to complete it to the standard that I normally do. I will update the planner soon to address the known issues.

#### Also, feel free to ignore all of my files labeled first try, I wanted to keep them so that I could see in my thought process, and so that I could refer back to them as I finish the project, but they are not active and do not work. Although, if you're curious, I suppose you could look through them... At your own risk, that is... The code is offensively bad...
